NGASI - Tomcat & Java Control Panel Details

Tomcat  is now installing under your account and it usually takes 30 minutes to complete so please be patient.
Tomcat  installation dir is located at /home/mngkovka/appservers/apache-tomcat-8x/.

To access your NGASI Control Panel , restart JVM, install other version use this URL and login with your cPanel username and password:

http://cp2.astrahosting.com:8666/zp/appservermgr/

Once you do that you will be loged into NGASI manager where you can restart your tomcat under Start/Stop section or Install Jboss, Glassfish, Jetty or Oracle-OC4J
if you want to use any of them instead Tomcat.


To deploy your java applications you need to put them into your /home/mngkovka/appservers/apache-tomcat-8x/webapps/ROOT/ folder and they will be
automatically deployed by your Tomcat. If application is in war file you will need to restart Tomcat from your Ngasi panel to deploy it.


You can also use Drag-And-Drop application manager to deploy your apps. To use it login here with your cpanel username and password:

https://cp2.astrahosting.com:8663/modules/uap/user/index.zul

Your Tomcat is up and runing as you can see if you visit this URL http://www.mngkovka.ru/hello2.jsp

To get your Tomcat runing and active under your domain name and to use it you need to change DNS servers for your domain name (if you host already registred domain name
with us) to cp2.astrahosting.com (192.69.210.154) and cp2b.astrahosting.com (192.69.210.155)


If you want to test your application before switching DNS servers than you need to use our DNS servers in your connection settings.

You will also need to setup mappings in apache server - which file or folder names you want to forward from Apache http server to your Tomcat server. To do that
just click on "Web Server and Hosting Manager Configuration" link on right panel inside NGASI manager. There you can route everything to your Tomcat server by
clicking on "Enable Wildcard Map" or you can add custom mapping under "Add Path Map" field.

Important NOTE: With NGASI Control Panel  you have ability to choose between five different JVM Servers.
You can choose between Tomcat, Glassfish, Wildfly, JBoss, Jetty and Oracle-OC4J.
All you need to do is to login into NGASI Control Panel select JVM you want, version you wand and click on Install tab.


For further instructions for setup of your java applications use Help menu from NGASI Manager, read our FAQ
or contact our support staff using ticket system or our live online chat.
